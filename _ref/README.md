This directory is for references to official libraries/snippets in order to:
 - easily reference in documentation and code comments
 - have working copies to add comments and enhance readability of minified code
 - have historical references when libraries are updated

These files are grouped into dirs by the source domain, and files named so:
 - `FILENAME.js` - Original filename; original code (see change history for recency).
 - `FILENAME.unmin.js` - Original code, un-minified (via Chrome DevTools' pretty-print feature).
 - `FILENAME.readable.js` - Original code, formatted and commented, with updated variable names for readability. Syntax may also be modified to be more verbose, but completely preserves original logic.
